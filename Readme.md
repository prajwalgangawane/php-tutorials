## CRUD Demo - Employees

In this PHP tutorial, we will be exploring a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) application featuring employee records. The demo application showcases how to interact with a MySQL database using PHP to perform basic CRUD operations.

### Getting Started

To run the CRUD demo, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository from [GitHub](https://github.com/prajwalgangawane/php-tutorials).
2. Set up a web server with PHP and MySQL support. You can use popular solutions like XAMPP or WAMP for local development.
3. Import the database schema from the `db/employees.sql` file into your MySQL server.
4. Ensure the `mysqli` extension is enabled in your PHP configuration.

### Running the Demo

1. Open your web browser and navigate to the project's root folder.
2. Launch the `index.html` file, which serves as the entry point to the CRUD application.

### Features

The CRUD demo provides the following functionalities:

- **Create**: Add new employees to the database by entering their details such as name, email, address, and phone number.

- **Read**: View the list of all employees and their respective details in a tabular format.

- **Update**: Edit the information of existing employees, including their name, email, address, and phone number.

- **Delete**: Remove employees from the database if they are no longer part of the organization.
